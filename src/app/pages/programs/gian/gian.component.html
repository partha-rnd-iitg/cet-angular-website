                    In order to (a) garner the best international experience into our systems of education, (b) enable interaction of students and faculty with the best academic/industry experts from all over the world, and (c) share their experiences and expertise to motivate people to work on Indian problems, there is a need for building up a global academic network. During the "Retreat" of IITs with Minister of Human Resource Development Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani on 29th June, 2014 at Goa, it was decided that “A system of Guest Lectures by internationally and nationally renowned experts would be evolved along with a comprehensive Faculty Development Program not only for the new IITs, IIMs, IISERs but also other institutions in the country."
